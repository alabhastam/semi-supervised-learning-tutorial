    " <p>Welcome to this hands-on tutorial on <strong>Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)</strong>! In many real-world machine learning projects, we face a common and critical challenge: a lack of labeled data. While collecting vast amounts of raw data (e.g., user activity logs, transaction records) is often straightforward, the process of manually labeling it is expensive, slow, and frequently requires specialized knowledge.</p>\n",

    "<p>This is the exact problem SSL is designed to solve. It builds a bridge between supervised learning (which needs fully labeled data) and unsupervised learning (which uses no labels).</p>\n",
